      <p>
        Our cookie is crafted with only the finest ingredients. Butter from grass-fed cows. 
        Unbleached flour with the best flavor and textures. Organic sugar only from India. 
        Eggs from chickens that listen to classical music. Even our water is special â€” it 
        comes from the Cascade Mountain springs that we hike up to retrieve.
      </p>
      <p>Baking is our passion and we take it very seriously.</p>
